## Hi 👋🏻

I'm Bilal, a senior full-stack developer passionate about building efficient and scalable software solutions. I specialize in the JS (TS) ecosystem, crafting both robust backends and dynamic frontends. My current focus is on building cutting-edge solutions using NestJS 🚀, a framework I deeply enjoy working with.

- 💬 Ask me about Node.js, Angular, vanilla JavaScript, and NestJS.  
- 🌱 I’m currently exploring Microservice architecture and building a [Microservice Product Management](https://github.com/BilalDja/microservice-product) project to deepen my understanding.  

I hope you'll find something useful in my repositories. 😊
